## Projects

### <span>Leveraging ML Forecast Models for Predictive Resource Provisioning in Flink Applications, 2024</span>
Collaborated with a team of three to transform an innovative idea into a production-ready solution, achieving 20% cost savings across all real-time pipelines.

Utilized a machine learning model to predict pipeline resource requirements, enabling dynamic scaling of resources based on throughput while maintaining latency within business-acceptable thresholds.

Delivered a robust system that optimizes cost efficiency without compromising performance, ensuring seamless operation for critical business use cases.

Recognized for its impact and innovation, the project was selected and presented at Flink Forward Berlin 2024 conference. https://www.flink-forward.org/berlin-2024/recordings#technology_deep_dive_flink_cdc

Technologies: Catboost, Machine Learning Techniques, Kubernetes, Flink, Python

### <span>Interactive Real-time data processing platform, 2023</span>
Designed and built an end-to-end solution enabling users to interact with stream data using FlinkSQL, addressing the challenge of analyzing real-time data in protobuf format.

Created a user-friendly platform that allows analytics users to write and deploy queries directly into FlinkSQL pipelines, simplifying real-time feature engineering, advanced analytics, and outage monitoring.

Overcame key challenges, including:

- Educating analytics users to transition from a batch processing mindset to a real-time mindset, introducing concepts like windows and watermarks
- Ensuring the platform was intuitive and accessible for low-code users, making real-time data analysis more approachable.

Empowered users to leverage SQL for real-time data exploration, reducing reliance on complex Flink Java/Scala implementations and improving overall productivity.

Technologies: Flink, FlinkSQL, Golang, Hive Metastore, Kubernetes, SQL, Python, Java

### <span>Credit Decision System, 2020</span>
Designed and developed a Credit Decision System integrated with Experian, a leading credit reporting agency, to automate and streamline credit strategy modifications. The system reduced turnaround time from 7 days to under 1 hour, significantly enhancing operational efficiency.

Built a user-friendly interface and a robust data pipeline to enable efficient credit decision-making, ensuring seamless adoption by business users. Successfully managed the transition from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to Production, delivering a reliable system that improved accuracy and reduced costs.

Addressed key challenges, including:

- Processing large volumes of data while maintaining compliance with strict SLAs for data processing times.
- Designing an intuitive, low-tech-friendly solution to accommodate non-technical business users, ensuring ease of use and adoption.

Technologies: Python, Spark, Django, Kubernetes, Airflow

### <span>Data Platform for Grab Finance Group, 2018</span>
As the first data engineer hired for Grab Finance Group, spearheaded the design and development of a data platform tailored for the lending division. The platform was built from scratch to accommodate the entity’s unique environment and tech stack, separate from Grab’s existing infrastructure due to the regulation.

Collaborated with a team of four to deliver a solution, including:

- A lakehouse architecture powered by Amazon S3 and Presto for scalable data storage and querying.
- A Spark cluster as a computational engine for large-scale data processing.
- A data science platform for model training and advanced analytics, enabling machine learning workflows.

Overcame significant challenges, including tight deadlines and limited resources, by building the entire infrastructure on AWS from the ground up. Deployed and configured critical tools such as Spark, Presto, JupyterHub, and Airflow to support the platform’s operations.

Partnered closely with the lending team to ingest and process terabytes of data into the lakehouse, ensuring alignment with business requirements and delivering actionable insights.

Technologies: Presto/Trino, Spark, Airflow, Kubernetes, JupyterHub, AWS, Python
